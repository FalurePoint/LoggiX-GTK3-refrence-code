Welcome to the first release of my software!
Please feel free to tell me what you think
and if you have any bug reports
those always help to...

Note: At the moment I am looking for
developers interested in helping
with LoTw and Qrz.com integration
if you are capable and this sound
interesting please contact me!
my website has ample information on it to
get you hooked up at https://qsl.net/kl5is/home.html
