 Current release versions:
   GUI: 2.3 Beta (1.x was discontinued before release, lots of bugs)
   Software: 1.0 Beta
   QRZ integration files: N/A
   LoTw integration files: N/A
 
 To install:

 2. Open the folder in your Terminal and run ./install.sh (Note that there is an Uninstall.sh file as well)
 
WARNING: This project is a WIP at the moment and although Qrz.com/LoTw integration is a goal the code to do it has not even been started on yet.

I plan to add Qrz.com myself but if anyone wants to start working on it before I get a chance to buy XML on QRZ please feel free to pull request your work!

If anyone knows how to get LoTw to work I would love you to pull request that to! I am willing to add you to the creators list in "about software" for this contribution if you like.

Suggestions are welcome! I want to see some input this app is far from perfect! Please email me at kl5is@qsl.net
