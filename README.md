WARNING: This project is a WIP at the moment and although Qrz.com/LoTw integration is a goal the code to do it has not even been started on yet.

If anyone knows how to get LoTw to work I would love you to pull request that to! I am willing to add you to the creators list in "about software" for this contribution if you like.

Suggestions are welcome! I want to see some input! this app is far from perfect! Please email me at kl5is@qsl.net if you have sugestions.
